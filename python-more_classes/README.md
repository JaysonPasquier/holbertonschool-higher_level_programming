## Description
This project focuses on advanced object-oriented programming concepts such as class methods, static methods, and more complex class structures in Python. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-more_classes
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Files
- `0-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle`.
- `1-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with width and height attributes.
- `2-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with methods to calculate area and perimeter.
- `3-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a string representation method.
- `4-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a method to print the rectangle.
- `5-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a method to delete the rectangle.
- `6-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a class attribute to keep track of the number of instances.
- `7-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a class method to compare rectangles.
- `8-rectangle.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Rectangle` with a static method to create a square.
