## Description
This project focuses on using modules and import statements in Python. It includes various scripts to practice importing functions, classes, and variables from different modules.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-import_modules
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Files
- `0-add.py`: A Python script that imports the function `add` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: A Python script that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and performs basic arithmetic operations.
- `2-args.py`: A Python script that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: A Python script that adds all the arguments passed to it and prints the result.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: A Python script that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- `5-variable_load.py`: A Python script that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.
