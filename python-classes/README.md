## Description
This project focuses on object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes in Python. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-classes
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Files
- `0-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square`.
- `1-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with a private instance attribute.
- `2-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with a private instance attribute and validation.
- `3-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with a method to calculate the area.
- `4-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with getter and setter methods.
- `5-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with a method to print the square.
- `6-square.py`: A Python script that defines a class `Square` with a method to print the square with position.
