## Description
This project focuses on control flow mechanisms such as if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-if_else_loops_functions
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Files
