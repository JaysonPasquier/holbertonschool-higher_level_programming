>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Test normal matrix division:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Test that original matrix is unchanged:
    >>> matrix
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Test with floating point numbers:
    >>> matrix = [[1.1, 2.2, 3.3], [4.4, 5.5, 6.6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.55, 1.1, 1.65], [2.2, 2.75, 3.3]]

Test division by negative number:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Test error for non-number div:
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "3")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Test error for division by zero:
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Test error for rows of different sizes:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Test error for invalid matrix (not a list of lists):
    >>> matrix = "not a matrix"
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test error for matrix with non-number elements:
    >>> matrix = [[1, "2", 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test empty matrix:
    >>> matrix_divided([], 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test matrix with empty row:
    >>> matrix_divided([[]], 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test None as matrix:
    >>> matrix_divided(None, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test None as divisor:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number
