## Description
This project focuses on the principles of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. It includes various scripts and test cases to practice writing tests before implementing the actual code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
- `unittest` module (included in the Python standard library)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/python-test_driven_development
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

To run the test cases, use the following command:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

## Files
- `0-add_integer.py`: A Python script that adds two integers.
- `2-matrix_divided.py`: A Python script that divides all elements of a matrix.
- `3-say_my_name.py`: A Python script that prints "My name is <first name> <last name>".
- `4-print_square.py`: A Python script that prints a square with the character `#`.
- `5-text_indentation.py`: A Python script that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?`, and `:`.
- `tests/`: A directory containing the test cases for the scripts.
